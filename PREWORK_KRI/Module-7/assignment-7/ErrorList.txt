wrong id was mentioned.1)img (open and close tag missing),and alt missing.

2)<script type="text/javascript" src="logic.js"></script>(correct)
  <script type="text/javascript" src="error.js.js"></script> (wrong file name for js) which was stopping all the function in the JS file.

3)      Correct
        <ol>
     	<li>Dressing Up</li>
	<li>Eating Grass</li>
	<li>Sleeping</li>
	<li>Swimming</li>
	<li>Hiking</li>
	</ol>
        Wrong : li tag was not uesd It use for numbering the list items.

4) Random BOO Button was not working because in the logic.js file the array declared does not contained "" for the array items.

5)Button Pink was not showing the Pink color because in the logic.js file 
        $("#textPink").on("click", function() {
	$("#funText").css("color", "pink")// corected "pink"
pink was not having double quotes.

6) Grow and shrink button was not working because the declaration for Click does not contained double Quotes.
$("#boxGrow").on("click", function() {
	$("#box").animate({height:"+=35px", 
		width:"+=35px"}, "fast");
})

$("#boxShrink").on("click", function() {
	$("#box").animate({height:"-=35px", width:"-=35px"}, "fast");
}) //Corret "click"
