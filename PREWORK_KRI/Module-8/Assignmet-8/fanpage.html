  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>Black Sabbath were an English rock band, formed in Birmingham in 1968, by guitarist and main songwriter Tony Iommi, bassist and main lyricist Geezer Butler, singer Ozzy Osbourne, and drummer Bill Ward. The band experienced multiple line-up changes, with Iommi being the only constant member throughout its history. Originally formed as a blues rock band, the group soon adopted the Black Sabbath moniker and began incorporating occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and tuned-down guitars. They also composed songs about social instability, political corruption and drugs.<br> Like them on facebook:<a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackSabbath/" target="_blank">Black Shabbat Facebook Page</a>
