The most challanging Thig out of the 12 listed :
1)Patience makes perfect.
 
2) Self-Care is Key


I am quite excited to start learning and enhance my learning , i allready have an programming experiences but i do have a Gap of 2 years 
from the time i have actually done the programming in real time , yes i have learned it as a THEORY but i think actual practise does matters
so i feel for me the most challanging part be "Patience makes perfect" the reason i will think of getting all things correct in one Go and 
i know which is not possible many a times and thus will loose my Patience and the cofidence and  i know will also have the Fear if i can complete it or not but 
i will actually try to Focous on this weak point and will put all the efforts on focussing on Coding rather than Reading which for sure will increase my patience 
to handle the situation correctly and i know i will able to make it its just the confidence i have lost sitting at home from a while but once 
i start the actual classes meeting up with the people and doing the Assigned work it will surely solve the problem .

Second thing i will i have to concentrate is on the "Self Care" Health so that it will not become a Barrier
